# Trash Heatmap

Trash Heatmap is a lightweight event management system for tracking when trash bins are emptied during large indoor events.

Workers scan a QR code attached to each trash bin and log when the bin has been emptied. The system collects this data and generates insights such as:

- Heatmaps of bin usage
- Worker activity tracking
- Most frequently emptied bins
- Recommendations for optimal bin placement next year

The system is designed to run on a **local Ubuntu laptop server** inside the event network.

# Features

### QR Code Bin Logging
Each trash bin has a QR code.

When scanned, the worker is taken to a logging page where they confirm:

- bin number
- their username

The system logs:

- worker name
- bin ID
- timestamp

---

### Smart Duplicate Protection

To prevent accidental double logging:

- Same worker cannot log the same bin within **2 minutes**

---

### Admin Panel

Admin can:

- Add workers
- Delete workers
- View registered users

Protected login required.

Default admin login:
username: Buildcat
password: buildcat

---

### Drag & Drop Bin Placement

Bins can be positioned on the event map using **drag & drop coordinates** instead of GPS.

This allows accurate indoor positioning.

---

### Heatmap Generation

The server can generate heatmaps showing:

- which bins are emptied most frequently
- which areas produce the most trash

This helps plan **better bin placement for future events**.

---

### Real-time Dashboard

Admin dashboard can display:

- most active bins
- most active workers
- live emptying logs

Useful during the event.

# Installation

Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kelemi90/trash_heatmap.git
cd trash_heatmap
```
Install dependencies
```npm install```

Start Server
```node server/server.js```

Server will start on:
```http://localhost:3001```

and also show the **local network IP address**.
Workers should use the **network address**.
Example:
```http://192.168.1.20:3001```
